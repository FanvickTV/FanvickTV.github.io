### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    While this is a pretty simple lab compared to what we do later on, this is the lab that really introduced me to what code could really do. I loved mad libs as a kid, and knowing I could use code to make that by myself made me feel interested in learning more code! This is basically the lab that sparked my creativity and motivation. So I had a lot of fun making a sandiwch themed mad libs, so much so that I started practicing on my own.

* Lab 6

   This lab was really fun because we started to work with the more visual aspects of code. To see the pattern come to life as a gif was super interesting! I always loved the cool and borderline goofy stuff you could do with the command line. I remember it fondly because the group I worked with made the learning more fun and interesting.

* Lab 9

    Here, things got very difficult for me. However I tried my best to power through and teach myself what I needed to finish the assignment. This made me learn that if I wanted to continue to do this, that I would need to have the motivation and willpower to keep going. It was also amazing to start learning the more complicated parts of C++, like reading from multiple files.
